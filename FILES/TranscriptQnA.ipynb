      " Welcome to the Ultimate Docker course.\n",
      " In this course, I'm going to take you on a journey and teach you everything you need\n",
      " to know about Docker from the basics to my advanced concepts.\n",
      " So by the end of this course, you'll be able to use it like a pro as part of your software\n",
      " Devonement workflow.\n",
      " If you're looking for a comprehensive and highly practical course that takes you from 0 to\n",
      " 0, this is the Docker course for you.\n",
      " We're going to start off with a really simple project so you understand the basics.\n",
      " Then we'll use Docker, run and deploy a full stack application with a front end, back\n",
      " end and a database.\n",
      " So you learn all the necessary techniques and apply them to your own projects.\n",
      " I'm Mosh Hamadani and I've taught millions of people how to advance their software engineering\n",
      " skills through my YouTube channel and online school code with mosh.com.\n",
      " If you're new here, be sure to subscribe as you upload new videos all the time.\n",
      " Now let's jump in and get started.\n",
      " Let's quickly talk about what you need to know to take this course.\n",
      " To take this course, you don't need any prior knowledge of Docker because I'm going to\n",
      " teach you everything from scratch, but you should have at least three months of program\n",
      " and experience.\n",
      " Ideally, you should have built at least one application so you should know concepts like\n",
      " front end, back end, API and database.\n",
      " It doesn't matter what language is and frameworks or what database engines you're familiar\n",
      " with, but you should know what these concepts are all about.\n",
      " Also you should be familiar with basic Git commands like clothing and GitHub repository,\n",
      " committing code, pushing and pulling.\n",
      " Just the basics, nothing more.\n",
      " With all that, let's move on to the next lesson.\n",
      " Now, we all have different ways of learning things, but let me tell you what I think is\n",
      " the best way to take this course.\n",
      " This course is highly practical, so you should be active while watching this course.\n",
      " In my opinion, it's best if you watch each lesson, take some notes.\n",
      " You can either take notes on a piece of paper or using your favorite note taken tool.\n",
      " Just write some keywords, some keywords that help you remember what we talked about.\n",
      " Then after each lesson, go through your notes and repeat the same steps I've taken in that\n",
      " lesson.\n",
      " So if I talked about a bunch of commands, play with those commands, make sure you understand\n",
      " how they work.\n",
      " If you follow that, I promise you, by the end of this course, you're going to master\n",
      " Docker and use it like a pro.\n",
      " All right, our journey to master Docker begins here.\n",
      " In every section, you're going to discover something new about Docker.\n",
      " In this section, we're going to talk about what Docker is and why it's so popular.\n",
      " Then we're going to talk about virtual machines and containers.\n",
      " Next, we're going to talk about the architecture of Docker, so you understand how it works.\n",
      " Then we're going to install Docker and get our hands dirty.\n",
      " I'm going to give you an overview of your development workflow with Docker.\n",
      " And then we're going to see that in action using a really simple example.\n",
      " So by the end of this section, you will have an idea of what Docker is all about.\n",
      " I'm so excited about this section.\n",
      " I hope you are too.\n",
      " So let's jump in and get started.\n",
      " So what is Docker and what is everyone using it these days?\n",
      " Well, Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications in a consistent\n",
      " manner.\n",
      " So if your application works on your development machine, it can run and function the\n",
      " same way on other machines.\n",
      " If you have been developing software for a while, you've probably come across this situation\n",
      " where your application works on your development machine, but doesn't somewhere else.\n",
      " Can you think of three reasons why this happens?\n",
      " Well, this can happen if one or more files are not included as part of your deployment.\n",
      " So your application is not completely deployed.\n",
      " It's missing something.\n",
      " This can also happen if the target machine is running a different version of some software\n",
      " that your application needs.\n",
      " Let's say your application needs node version 14, but the target machine is running node\n",
      " version 9.\n",
      " This can also happen if the configuration settings like environment variables are different across\n",
      " these machines.\n",
      " And this is where Docker comes to the rescue with Docker.\n",
      " We can easily package up our application with everything it needs and run it anywhere\n",
      " on any machine with Docker.\n",
      " So if your application needs a given version of node and MongoDB, all of these will be included\n",
      " in your application's package.\n",
      " Now, we can take this package and run it on any machine that runs Docker.\n",
      " So if it works on your development machine, it's definitely going to work on your test\n",
      " and production machines.\n",
      " Now, there's more.\n",
      " If someone joins your team, they don't have to spend half a day or so setting up a new\n",
      " machine to run your application.\n",
      " They don't have to install and configure all these dependencies.\n",
      " They simply tell Docker to bring up your application and Docker itself will automatically download\n",
      " and run these dependencies inside an isolated environment called a container.\n",
      " And this is the beauty of Docker.\n",
      " This isolated environment allows multiple applications use different versions of some software\n",
      " side by side.\n",
      " So one application may use node version 14.\n",
      " Another application may use node version 9.\n",
      " Both these applications can run side by side on the same machine without messing with\n",
      " each other.\n",
      " So this is how Docker allows us to consistently run an application on different machines.\n",
      " Now, there's one more benefit here.\n",
      " When we're done with this application and don't want to work on it anymore, we can remove\n",
      " the application and all these dependencies in one go.\n",
      " Without Docker, as we work on different projects, our development machine gets cluttered with\n",
      " so many libraries and tools that are used by different applications.\n",
      " And then after a while, we don't know if we can remove one or more of these tools because\n",
      " we're always afraid that we would mess up with some application.\n",
      " With Docker, we don't have to worry about this.\n",
      " Because each application runs with its dependencies inside an isolated environment, we can save\n",
      " the removal of an application with all these dependencies to clean up our machine.\n",
      " Isn't that great?\n",
      " So in a nutshell, Docker helps us consistently build, run, and ship our applications.\n",
      " And that's why a lot of employers are looking for people with Docker skills these days.\n",
      " So if you're pursuing a job as a software or DevOps engineer, I highly encourage you\n",
      " to learn Docker and learn it well.\n",
      " And that's exactly what this course is all about.\n",
      " I'm going to take you on a journey and teach you everything you need to know about Docker\n",
      " so you can use it like a pro.\n",
      " No copy-pasting commands here.\n",
      " So in the last lesson, I briefly talked about containers.\n",
      " A container is an isolated environment for running an application.\n",
      " Now one of the questions that often comes up is how are containers different from virtual\n",
      " machines or VMs?\n",
      " Do you know the differences?\n",
      " A virtual machine, as the name implies, is an abstraction of a machine or physical hardware.\n",
      " So we can run several virtual machines on a real physical machine.\n",
      " For example, we can have a Mac and on this Mac, we can run two virtual machines, one\n",
      " running Windows, the other running Linux.\n",
      " How do we do that?\n",
      " Using a tool called Hypervisor.\n",
      " I know, it's one of those computer science names.\n",
      " In simple terms, a hypervisor is software we use to create and manage virtual machines.\n",
      " There are many hypervisors available out there like virtual box and VMware, which are\n",
      " cross-platform so they can run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, and Hyper-V, which is only\n",
      " for Windows.\n",
      " So with a hypervisor, we can manage virtual machines.\n",
      " Now what is the benefit of building virtual machines?\n",
      " Well, for us software developers, we can run an application in isolation inside a virtual\n",
      " machine.\n",
      " So on the same physical machine, we can have two different virtual machines, each running\n",
      " a completely different application and each application has the exact dependencies it\n",
      " needs.\n",
      " So application one may use node version 14 and MongoDB version 4, while application two\n",
      " may use node version 9 and MongoDB version 3.\n",
      " All these are running on the same machine, but in different isolated environments.\n",
      " That's one of the benefits of virtual machines, but there are a number of problems with this\n",
      " model.\n",
      " Each virtual machine needs a full copy of an operating system that needs to be licensed,\n",
      " attached and monitored.\n",
      " And that's why these virtual machines are slow to start because the entire operating system\n",
      " has to be loaded just like starting your computer.\n",
      " Another problem is that these virtual machines are resource intensive because each virtual\n",
      " machine takes a slice of the actual physical hardware resources like CPU, memory and disk\n",
      " space.\n",
      " So if you have eight gigabytes of memory, that memory has to be divided between different\n",
      " virtual machines.\n",
      " Of course, we can decide how much memory to allocate to each virtual machine, but at the\n",
      " end of the day, we have a limit in terms of the number of VMs we can run on a machine.\n",
      " Usually a handful otherwise we're going to run out of hardware resources.\n",
      " Now let's talk about containers.\n",
      " Containers give us the same kind of isolation, so we can run multiple applications in isolation,\n",
      " but they're more lightweight.\n",
      " They don't need a full operating system.\n",
      " In fact, all containers on a single machine share the operating system of the host.\n",
      " So that means we need to license, patch and monitor a single operating system.\n",
      " Also because the operating system has already started on the host, a container can start\n",
      " up pretty quickly, usually in a second, sometimes less.\n",
      " And also, these containers don't need a slice of the hardware resources on the host.\n",
      " So we don't need to give them a specific number of CPU cores or a slice of memory or disk\n",
      " space.\n",
      " So at a single host, we can run tens or even hundreds of containers side by side.\n",
      " So these are the differences between containers and virtual machines.\n",
      " Let's talk about the architecture of Docker, so you understand how it works.\n",
      " Docker uses a client server architecture, so it has a client component that talks to a\n",
      " server component using a RESTful API.\n",
      " The server also called the Docker engine sits on the background and takes care of building\n",
      " and running Docker containers.\n",
      " Technically, a container is just a process, like other processes running on your computer,\n",
      " but it's a special kind of process which we're going to talk about soon.\n",
      " Now, as I told you, unlike virtual machines, containers don't contain a full blown operating\n",
      " system.\n",
      " Instead, all containers on a host share the operating system of the host.\n",
      " But more accurately, all those containers share the kernel of the host.\n",
      " What's a kernel?\n",
      " A kernel is the core of an operating system.\n",
      " It's like the engine of a car.\n",
      " It's the part that manages all applications as well as hardware resources like memory and\n",
      " CPU.\n",
      " Every operating system has its own kernel or engine, and these kernels have different\n",
      " APIs.\n",
      " That's why we cannot run a Windows application on Linux because under the hood, this application\n",
      " is to talk to the kernel of the underlying operating system.\n",
      " OK?\n",
      " So, that means on a Linux machine, we can only run Linux containers because these containers\n",
      " need Linux.\n",
      " On a Windows machine, however, we can run both Windows and Linux containers because Windows\n",
      " 10 is now shipped with a custom built Linux kernel.\n",
      " This is in addition to the Windows kernel that's always been in Windows.\n",
      " It's not a replacement.\n",
      " So with this Linux kernel, now we can run Linux applications natively on Windows.\n",
      " So on Windows, we can run both Linux and Windows containers.\n",
      " Our Windows containers share the Windows kernel and our Linux containers share the Linux\n",
      " kernel.\n",
      " OK?\n",
      " Now, what about Mac OS?\n",
      " Well, Mac OS has its own kernel, which is different from Linux and Windows kernels,\n",
      " and this kernel does not have native support for containers applications.\n",
      " So the darker on Mac uses a lightweight Linux virtual machine to run Linux containers.\n",
      " All right.\n",
      " Now, let's talk about architecture.\n",
      " Next, we're going to install Docker, and that's where the fun begins.\n",
      " All right.\n",
      " Now let's install the latest version of Docker.\n",
      " If you have an existing version of Docker on your machine, I highly encourage you to\n",
      " upgrade to the latest version because your version might be old and not compatible with\n",
      " the version I'm using in this course.\n",
      " So here I'm using Docker version 20.10.5.\n",
      " OK?\n",
      " So to get Docker, go to this page docs.docker.com slash get Docker, or you can just Google get\n",
      " Docker or install Docker.\n",
      " Now on this page, we can see instructions for downloading and installing Docker desktop\n",
      " for Mac and Windows, as well as Docker Engine for Linux.\n",
      " So on Mac and Windows, we have Docker desktop, which is the combination of Docker Engine\n",
      " plus a bunch of other tools.\n",
      " At the time of recording this, we don't have Docker desktop for Linux.\n",
      " We only have the Docker Engine, but of course that might change in the future.\n",
      " So a couple of notes for my Mac and Windows users.\n",
      " Let's go through this page.\n",
      " So over here, you can download the latest version from Docker Hub.\n",
      " But before doing this, I highly encourage you to go through a system requirements and make\n",
      " sure your computer satisfies these requirements.\n",
      " Otherwise, you might encounter weird issues.\n",
      " So the installation is pretty straightforward.\n",
      " When you go to this page, you're going to download a DMG file.\n",
      " Just drag and drop this onto the application folder and then start it.\n",
      " This is very important.\n",
      " A lot of people miss that step.\n",
      " So when you start Docker Engine by double clicking on this application, you're going to\n",
      " see the Docker icon on the top status bar.\n",
      " If you don't see this, Docker Engine is not running and there is nothing you can do.\n",
      " So you have to wait for this to start.\n",
      " The same applies to my Windows users.\n",
      " So back to this page.\n",
      " Let's look at the instructions for Windows.\n",
      " So once again, you can download the latest version from Docker Hub.\n",
      " But once again, make sure to read system requirements.\n",
      " One of the things that is really important is enabling Hyper-V and Container's Windows\n",
      " features.\n",
      " So I don't have a Windows machine to show you here, but just go to the page where you\n",
      " can turn on or turn off Windows features.\n",
      " There, make sure you have enabled Hyper-V and Containers.\n",
      " It's pretty straightforward, but if you can't find it, just google it.\n",
      " I'm pretty sure there are tons of articles out there.\n",
      " Also at the end of the installation, you might get an error saying WS2 installation is incomplete.\n",
      " Basically, what this error is saying is that you need to upgrade the Linux kernel that\n",
      " is shipped with your Windows.\n",
      " So just click on this link.\n",
      " This is going to take you to this page on Microsoft.com where you can download the latest Linux\n",
      " kernel.\n",
      " So just click on this link to get an MSI file, run it, and then you have to restart your\n",
      " computer.\n",
      " Now, once your computer is re-started, you need to wait a little while until Docker Engine\n",
      " started.\n",
      " Depending on your machine, this might take several seconds or up to a minute.\n",
      " So wait a little while, then open up a terminal window and run Docker version.\n",
      " So over here, you can see the version of the client and the server.\n",
      " If the server, which is Docker Engine, is not running, you are not going to see this\n",
      " information.\n",
      " And this applies to all operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\n",
      " So make sure Docker Engine is running before going forward.\n",
      " If you encounter any errors, you can post your question on our forum at forum.co.wetmosh.com\n",
      " or if you want a faster response, just google the error message and pretty sure hundreds\n",
      " of people have encountered the same problem as you.\n",
      " Now let's talk about your development workflow when using Docker.\n",
      " So to start off, we take an application.\n",
      " It doesn't matter what kind of application it is or how it's built.\n",
      " We take that application and Dockerize it, which means we make a small change so that\n",
      " it can be run by Docker.\n",
      " How?\n",
      " We just add a Docker file to it.\n",
      " A Docker file is a plain text file that includes instructions that Docker uses to package\n",
      " of this application into an image.\n",
      " This image contains everything our application needs to run.\n",
      " Typically, it cut down operating system, a runtime environment like Node or Python.\n",
      " It also contains application files, third party libraries, environment variables, and so\n",
      " on.\n",
      " So we create a Docker file and give it to Docker for packaging our application into an\n",
      " image.\n",
      " Once we have an image, we tell Docker to start a container using that image.\n",
      " So a container as I told you is just a process.\n",
      " But it's a special kind of process because it has its own file system which is provided\n",
      " by the image.\n",
      " So our application gets loaded inside a container or a process and this is how we run our application\n",
      " locally on our development machine.\n",
      " So instead of directly launching the application and running it inside a typical process, we\n",
      " tell Docker to run it inside a container, an isolated environment.\n",
      " Now here's the beauty of Docker.\n",
      " Once we have this image, we can push it to a Docker registry like Docker Hub.\n",
      " Docker Hub to Docker is like GitHub to Git.\n",
      " It's a storage for Docker images that anyone can use.\n",
      " So once our application image is on Docker Hub, then we can put it on any machines running\n",
      " Docker.\n",
      " This machine has the same image we have on our development machine, which contains a specific\n",
      " version of our application with everything it needs.\n",
      " So we can start our application the same way we started it on our development machine.\n",
      " We just tell Docker to start a container using this image.\n",
      " So with Docker, we no longer need to maintain long, complex, released documents that have\n",
      " to be precisely followed.\n",
      " All the instructions for building an image of an application are written in a Docker file.\n",
      " With that, we can package our application into an image and run it virtually anywhere.\n",
      " This is the beauty of Docker.\n",
      " Next, we're going to see this workflow in action.\n",
      " In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through a typical development workflow that don't\n",
      " try to memorize anything in this lesson because I just want you to see the big picture.\n",
      " So everything I show you in this lesson, we're going to cover in depth later in the course.\n",
      " So here in this terminal window, I'm currently on my desktop.\n",
      " I'm going to create a new directory called HelloDocker, then go inside this directory and\n",
      " open it in Visual Studio Code.\n",
      " So I'm going to use VS Code as my editor, but you can use any editor that you prefer.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now in this directory, I'm going to add a new file called app.js.\n",
      " You're going to write one line of JavaScript code.\n",
      " You don't have to be a JavaScript developer.\n",
      " You don't even need to learn JavaScript.\n",
      " So just follow along with me.\n",
      " So here we're going to write console in lowercase.log.\n",
      " Hello Docker.\n",
      " So with this, we're going to print a message on the terminal.\n",
      " Let's say this is an application and we want to dockerize this application.\n",
      " So we want to build, run and ship it using Docker.\n",
      " So typically without Docker, if you want to ship this application or more accurate than\n",
      " this program to a different computer, on that computer, we need to install node.\n",
      " And then we can go to the terminal and type nodeapp.js.\n",
      " So we get the output.\n",
      " So here are the instructions for deploying this program.\n",
      " We need to start with an operating system.\n",
      " Then we need to install node, which is an execution environment for JavaScript code.\n",
      " Next we need to copy our application files and finally we need to run nodeapp.js.\n",
      " So we have to follow four steps just for a simple program.\n",
      " And if you were working with a really complex application, you would end up with a complex\n",
      " release document that had to be precisely followed.\n",
      " Now this is where Docker comes to the rescue.\n",
      " We can write these instructions inside a Docker file and let Docker package our application.\n",
      " So back to VS code, we're going to add another file to this project called Docker file.\n",
      " So capital D and all the other letters are lowercase.\n",
      " And this file doesn't have any extensions.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now VS code is asking if you want to install the recommended extensions for Docker, we\n",
      " can go ahead with that.\n",
      " Good.\n",
      " So back to this Docker file, here we write instructions for package our application.\n",
      " So typically we start from a base image.\n",
      " This base image as a bunch of files, we're going to take those files and add additional\n",
      " files to it.\n",
      " This is kind of like inheritance in programming.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " So what is the base image?\n",
      " Well, we can start from a Linux image and then install node on top of it.\n",
      " Or we can start from a node image.\n",
      " This image is already built on top of Linux.\n",
      " Now how do I know these names?\n",
      " Well, these images are officially published on Docker Hub.\n",
      " So if you go to hub.docker.com and search for node, you can see the official node image\n",
      " here.\n",
      " So Docker Hub is a registry for Docker images.\n",
      " Now back to a Docker file.\n",
      " So we start from a node image.\n",
      " Now if you look at Docker Hub, you will see that there are multiple node images.\n",
      " These node images are built on top of different distributions of Linux.\n",
      " So Linux has different distributions or different flavors used for different purposes.\n",
      " Now here we can specify a tag using a colon to specify which Linux distribution we want\n",
      " to use for this demo.\n",
      " I'm going to use Alpine, which is a very small Linux distribution.\n",
      " So the size of the image that we're going to download and build on top of is going\n",
      " to be very small.\n",
      " So we start from that image.\n",
      " Then we need to copy our application or program files.\n",
      " For that we use the copy instruction or copy command.\n",
      " We're going to copy all the files in the current directory into the app directory into\n",
      " that image.\n",
      " So that image has a file system and in that file system we're going to create a directory\n",
      " called app.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now finally we're going to use the command instruction to execute the command.\n",
      " What command should we execute here?\n",
      " Node app.js.\n",
      " But this file is inside the app directory.\n",
      " So we have to prefix it with a directory name.\n",
      " Alternatively here we could set the current working directory work dir to slash app.\n",
      " And then we don't need to prefix this with the directory name.\n",
      " So when we use this instruction all the following instructions assume that we're currently\n",
      " inside the app directory.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " So these instructions clearly document our deployment process.\n",
      " Now we go to the terminal and tell Docker to package up our application.\n",
      " So we say Docker build.\n",
      " We need to give our image a tag, a tag to identify.\n",
      " So dash t here we specify a name like hello Docker.\n",
      " And then we need to specify where Docker can find a Docker file.\n",
      " So we're currently inside hello Docker directory and our Docker file is right here.\n",
      " So we use a period to reference the current directory.\n",
      " Let's go with that.\n",
      " Now you might be expecting an image file inside the current directory.\n",
      " But back in VS code look there is nothing here because the image is not stored here.\n",
      " And in fact an image is not a single file.\n",
      " How Docker stores this image is very complex and we don't have to worry about it.\n",
      " So back to the terminal to see all the images on this computer.\n",
      " We type Docker images or Docker image LS which is short for less.\n",
      " So take a look on this machine.\n",
      " We have a repository called hello Docker in this repository.\n",
      " We have an image with this tag latest.\n",
      " So Docker added this by default.\n",
      " We'll talk about this later in the course.\n",
      " But basically we use these tags for versioning our images.\n",
      " So each image can contain a different version of our application.\n",
      " OK.\n",
      " Now each image also has a unique identifier.\n",
      " Here we can see when the image was created and the size of this image.\n",
      " So because we used node from Linux Alpine we ended up with 112 megabytes of data in this image.\n",
      " So this image contains Alpine Linux node and our application files.\n",
      " And the total size is 112 megabytes.\n",
      " If we used a different node image that was based on a different distribution of Linux,\n",
      " we would end up with a larger image.\n",
      " And then when deploying that image, we would have to transfer that image from one computer to another.\n",
      " So that's why we use node Alpine because this is a very small image.\n",
      " OK.\n",
      " So we built this image.\n",
      " Now we can run this image on any computer running Docker.\n",
      " So on this machine, which is my development machine, I can say Docker run and then type the image name.\n",
      " Hello, Docker.\n",
      " And it doesn't matter which directory I'm in because this image contains all the files for running our application.\n",
      " Now look, we see the message on the terminal.\n",
      " Now I can go ahead and publish this image to Docker Hub.\n",
      " So anyone can use this image.\n",
      " Then I can go on another machine like a test or a production machine and pull and run this image.\n",
      " In fact, I've done this before recording this video.\n",
      " So back to Docker Hub.\n",
      " Look, I have this repository called with mosh slash hello Docker.\n",
      " Now we can take this image and run it on any computers.\n",
      " Let me show you something really cool.\n",
      " So let's search for play with Docker.\n",
      " Let's go through this page and login.\n",
      " Here we need to sign in with our Docker ID.\n",
      " Anyone can create this ID on Docker.com.\n",
      " So let's go ahead and start a lab.\n",
      " Over here, we can start a new virtual machine.\n",
      " So let's add a new instance.\n",
      " Now this virtual machine is a black machine.\n",
      " It only has an operating system, which is Linux and Docker.\n",
      " So in this terminal window, if we type node.\n",
      " Look, node command not found.\n",
      " So node is not installed here.\n",
      " But because we have Docker, we can pull and run the image that I published on Docker Hub.\n",
      " So let me maximize this window by pressing alt and enter.\n",
      " First, let's run Docker version.\n",
      " So on this machine, we're running Docker version 20.10.0.\n",
      " So to pull and run my program, first we type Docker pool, code with mosh slash hello-docker.\n",
      " We are at Docker downloaded this image.\n",
      " We can verify it by typing Docker.\n",
      " What command should we run here?\n",
      " Docker images or image elas.\n",
      " So on this machine, we have this repository, code with mosh slash hello-docker.\n",
      " And this repository contains a single image with this tag latest.\n",
      " So now we can run this application exactly the same way we run it on my development machine.\n",
      " So from any directory, we can type Docker, run, code with mosh slash hello-docker.\n",
      " And here's the message, beautiful.\n",
      " Of course, I had to cut this down in editing.\n",
      " It took a little while to start this application on this very slow virtual machine.\n",
      " But you got the point.\n",
      " So we can take any application and dockerize it by adding a Docker file to it.\n",
      " This Docker file contains instructions for packaging an application into an image.\n",
      " So just to have an image, we can run it virtually anywhere on any machine with Docker.\n",
      " Hey guys, mosh here.\n",
      " If you're serious about learning Docker, I actually have a complete Docker course on my\n",
      " coding school code with mosh.com.\n",
      " This tutorial you've been watching is a cut down version of the complete course.\n",
      " In the full course, you will learn how to run and deploy a full stack application with\n",
      " a front end, back end, and a database.\n",
      " Our application also includes automated tests.\n",
      " So it's a great real-world scenario for learning Docker.\n",
      " Just like my other courses, you will also receive a 30-day money-back guarantee and a certificate\n",
      " of completion you can add to your resume.\n",
      " In case you're interested, you can find the link down below in the description box.\n",
      " Alright, the next topic in our journey is the Linux command line.\n",
      " But why Linux?\n",
      " What if you're a Windows user?\n",
      " Well, you still need to know a bit of Linux for a number of reasons.\n",
      " The starter, Docker has its foundations built on top of basic Linux concepts.\n",
      " So if you want to be productive and troubleshoot issues easily, you need to know some of the\n",
      " basic Linux commands.\n",
      " Also, most tutorials online are based on Linux commands, so if you don't understand\n",
      " these basic commands, you're not going to get far.\n",
      " In my opinion, learning Linux is like learning English.\n",
      " I think everybody should know some English these days.\n",
      " You don't need to speak it or write a book in it, but you need to understand it.\n",
      " So unless you're a power Linux user, do not skip the section.\n",
      " It's going to be super easy and extremely useful.\n",
      " So let's jump in and get started.\n",
      " Let's start off this section by talking about Linux distributions, also called Linux\n",
      " distros.\n",
      " So as you probably know, Linux is open-source software.\n",
      " And for this reason, many individuals and communities have created their own version\n",
      " of Linux called Linux distributions.\n",
      " Each of these distributions is made to fit specialized needs like running servers, desktop\n",
      " computers, mobile phones, and so on.\n",
      " So we have Ubuntu, which is one of the most popular Linux distributions.\n",
      " We also have Debian, Alpine, which we briefly talked about.\n",
      " It's a very small Linux distribution.\n",
      " We also have Fedora, CentOS, and so on.\n",
      " Believe it or not, there are more than 1,000 Linux distributions out there.\n",
      " Now, most of these distributions support pretty much the same set of commands, but sometimes\n",
      " you might discover differences along the way, so be aware of that.\n",
      " In this section, we're going to use Ubuntu Linux because it's one of the most popular\n",
      " distributions.\n",
      " But if you have a preference for another distribution, that's totally fine.\n",
      " All right, let's see how we can run Ubuntu and this machine.\n",
      " From this lesson, I want you to start taking notes.\n",
      " So watch this video, take some notes, and then after the video, repeat the steps I have\n",
      " shown you.\n",
      " Okay?\n",
      " So we go to hop.docker.com and search for Ubuntu.\n",
      " Over here, you can see the official Ubuntu image that's been downloaded more than 10 million\n",
      " times.\n",
      " Let's have a quick look here.\n",
      " So for each image, you can see the command to pull that image onto your machine.\n",
      " Now, in this lesson, I'm not going to use the pool command.\n",
      " I'm going to show you a shortcut.\n",
      " So here in the terminal, instead of running docker pool Ubuntu, I'm going to run docker run\n",
      " Ubuntu.\n",
      " Now, if you have this image locally, docker is going to start a container with this image.\n",
      " Otherwise, it's going to pull this image behind the scene and then start a container.\n",
      " So take a look.\n",
      " So, docker is unable to find this image locally and now is pulling it from docker hop.\n",
      " Now, what happened?\n",
      " Well, docker started a container, but because we didn't interact with this container,\n",
      " the container stopped.\n",
      " Let me prove this to you.\n",
      " So if you run docker.ps, we can see the list of running processes or running containers.\n",
      " Look, we don't have any containers running here, but if you type docker.ps-a for all, we\n",
      " can see the stopped containers as well.\n",
      " Let me increase the size of the window so we can see it clearly.\n",
      " Good.\n",
      " So we have two stopped containers.\n",
      " The first one is using the Ubuntu image.\n",
      " This is the one that we just started and the second one is hello docker, which we started\n",
      " earlier in the course.\n",
      " So to start a container and interact with it, we have to type docker run dash it that\n",
      " is short for interactive.\n",
      " We're going to start a container in the interactive mode.\n",
      " In this container, we're going to load the Ubuntu image, which we have locally.\n",
      " Good.\n",
      " Now, what we have here is called the shell.\n",
      " A shell is a program that takes our commands and passes them to the operating system for\n",
      " execution.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now, what we have here is called the shell prompt.\n",
      " Let me break it down for you so it doesn't look mysterious.\n",
      " The first part, root represents the currently locked in user.\n",
      " So by default, I'm locked in as the root user, which has the highest privileges.\n",
      " And after the at sign, we have the name of the machine.\n",
      " So this container has this ID, which is automatically generated by docker.\n",
      " And in this case, it's like the name of a machine.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " And after the colon, you can see forward slash that represents where we are in the file\n",
      " system.\n",
      " And forward slash represents the root directory.\n",
      " That is the highest directory in the file system.\n",
      " We'll talk about that soon.\n",
      " Then we have a pound.\n",
      " And this means I have the highest privileges.\n",
      " And this I've locked in as the root user.\n",
      " If I locked in as a normal user, instead of a pound, we would see a dollar sign.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " So in this shell, we can execute a bunch of commands.\n",
      " For example, we can say echo.\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      " And this prints hello on the terminal.\n",
      " We can also say, who am I?\n",
      " This shows the current user.\n",
      " So this commands that we're running here, this shell program that I told you about takes\n",
      " this command and passes them to the kernel for execution.\n",
      " Now, let me show you something really cool.\n",
      " Let's be type echo dollar sign zero.\n",
      " We can see the location of this shell program.\n",
      " Take a look.\n",
      " So that is forward slash bin slash bash.\n",
      " So bin is a folder or a directory.\n",
      " And inside this directory, we have a program called bash, which is short for born again\n",
      " shell.\n",
      " So apparently, Steve born is the first person who created a shell program.\n",
      " Bash or born again shell is a reference to Steve born.\n",
      " So bash is an enhanced version of the original shell program.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now one thing you probably noticed is that in Linux, we use a forward slash to separate files\n",
      " and directories.\n",
      " But in Windows, we use a backslash.\n",
      " So that's one of the first differences.\n",
      " The other difference is that Linux is a case sensitive operating system.\n",
      " So if you type echo with a capital E, it's not going to work.\n",
      " Bash tells us echo command not found.\n",
      " So lowercase and uppercase letters are different.\n",
      " And this is not limited to commands.\n",
      " It's applicable everywhere.\n",
      " If you want to reference a file or a directory or a user pretty much anything, we should always\n",
      " spell it properly with the right upper case and lowercase letters.\n",
      " Now one last thing for this lesson using the up and down arrows.\n",
      " We can go through the commands we have executed so far.\n",
      " So this is a pretty useful shortcut you need to know because you don't want to type these\n",
      " commands manually all the time.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Also, using the history command, we can see all the commands we have executed lately.\n",
      " So take a look.\n",
      " So earlier we used who am I.\n",
      " We also used echo and so on.\n",
      " Now we can replay any of these commands by typing an exclamation mark followed by the\n",
      " command number.\n",
      " So if I type two, this is exactly like running who am I.\n",
      " Now is your turn.\n",
      " I want you to pause the video, go through your notes and execute the commands I have shown\n",
      " you in this video.\n",
      " These days, most operating systems and development platforms come with a package manager.\n",
      " You've probably worked with tools like NPM, yarn, pip and so on.\n",
      " Here in Ubuntu, we also have a package manager called apt, which is short for advanced\n",
      " package tool.\n",
      " So let's execute this command.\n",
      " Look, this command has a bunch of sub commands.\n",
      " So using list, we can see the list of packages.\n",
      " We can also search for them.\n",
      " We can show details about the package.\n",
      " We can install, reinstall and remove a package and so on.\n",
      " Now technically, apt is the newer package manager.\n",
      " We also have apt yet, which you see a lot in online tutorials going forward.\n",
      " We're going to use apt because it's easier to work with.\n",
      " So let's say we want to install a package called nano.\n",
      " Nano is a basic text editor for Linux.\n",
      " If you press enter here, we get an error because this image, this Ubuntu image we are\n",
      " running does not have nano.\n",
      " So this is where we use apt to install this package.\n",
      " So if we type apt install nano, we get an error saying unable to locate package nano.\n",
      " Where is this happening?\n",
      " Well, here in Linux, we have the package database and this database might contain hundreds\n",
      " of packages, but not all these packages are installed.\n",
      " So if you want to see all the packages in this database, we type apt list.\n",
      " Look, these are all the packages.\n",
      " Now, in front of these packages, you can see some of them are installed, but not all\n",
      " packages in this database are installed.\n",
      " When we type apt install nano, this command looks at the package database and in this database,\n",
      " it cannot find a package called nano.\n",
      " So this is where we use the update command to update the package database.\n",
      " Now, let me press enter.\n",
      " Then it's going to all these sources like security.ubuntu.com and all these other websites\n",
      " to download the list of packages.\n",
      " So now our package database is updated.\n",
      " So if you run apt list, we see far more packages.\n",
      " And as you can see, most of these packages are not installed because we don't have installed\n",
      " in front of them.\n",
      " So now we can run apt install nano and nano is installed.\n",
      " So here is what you need to take away.\n",
      " Before installing a package, you should always run apt update to update your package database\n",
      " and then you can install a package like nano.\n",
      " Now, we'll talk about nano later in this section.\n",
      " But before going forward, let's make sure that this package is installed properly.\n",
      " So if you type nano, great.\n",
      " So here we have a takes editor, we can type something.\n",
      " Let me resize the window.\n",
      " So down below, you can see the shortcuts.\n",
      " To exit, we have to press control and X.\n",
      " Now it's asking if you want to save the changes, no, so we're going to press N, good.\n",
      " We're back here.\n",
      " We can clear the terminal window by pressing control and L.\n",
      " Okay?\n",
      " So we have installed nano.\n",
      " Now let's say we want to remove it.\n",
      " So we type apt remove nano.\n",
      " Let's ask him for confirmation.\n",
      " Let's go ahead.\n",
      " Great.\n",
      " So nano is gone.\n",
      " If I type nano, we get this error saying no such file or directory.\n",
      " Now here's a little exercise for you.\n",
      " In this image, we don't have Python.\n",
      " So we get an error.\n",
      " So I want you to use apt to install Python in this image, make sure it works and then remove\n",
      " it.\n",
      " So in Linux, just like Windows, our files and directories are organized in a tree in a\n",
      " hierarchical structure.\n",
      " So in Windows, we have a structure like this with C drive on top of the hierarchy.\n",
      " Then below that, we have directories like program files, windows and so on.\n",
      " In Linux, we have the root directory on top of the hierarchy.\n",
      " Below that, we have a bunch of standard directories.\n",
      " For example, we have Ben, which includes binaries or programs.\n",
      " We have boot, which includes all the files related to booting.\n",
      " Then we have dev.\n",
      " The first time I saw this, I thought this is short for development.\n",
      " It's not.\n",
      " It's short for devices.\n",
      " So in Linux, everything is a file, including devices, directories, network socket, pipes\n",
      " and so on.\n",
      " So the files that are needed to access devices are stored in this directory.\n",
      " Then we have Etsy.\n",
      " There are different opinions.\n",
      " What is this short for?\n",
      " But one common opinion is this is short for editable text configuration.\n",
      " This is where we have configuration files.\n",
      " We also have home.\n",
      " This is where home directories for users are stored.\n",
      " So on a machine with multiple users, each user is going to have a home directory here.\n",
      " We also have root, which is the home directory of the root user.\n",
      " Only the root user can access this directory.\n",
      " Then we have lib, which is used for keeping library files like software library dependencies.\n",
      " We have war, which is short for variable.\n",
      " And this is where we have files that are updated frequently, like log files, application\n",
      " data and so on.\n",
      " And finally, we have proc, which includes files that represent running processes.\n",
      " So once again, in Linux, everything is a file.\n",
      " Processes, devices, even directories are files.\n",
      " Now, you don't need to memorize any of these directories.\n",
      " I just listed them here.\n",
      " So as we go through the course, these directories look familiar to you.\n",
      " That's all.\n",
      " Next I'm going to show you how to navigate the file system.\n",
      " And there you will see these directories one more time.\n",
      " Let's see how we can navigate the Linux file system.\n",
      " So the first command we're going to talk about is Pwd, which is short for print working directory.\n",
      " With this, we can see where we are in the file system.\n",
      " So a forward slash represents the root directory.\n",
      " Now to see the files and directories here, we type LS, which is short for list.\n",
      " So we have been, which we talked about earlier, that is short for binaries.\n",
      " This is where we have binary files and programs.\n",
      " We have dev, which includes files for devices.\n",
      " We have boot, which includes boot files, Etsy, which includes configuration files and so on.\n",
      " Now by default, LS lists these items on multiple lines.\n",
      " If you don't like this layout, and want to show one item per line, you need to pass an\n",
      " option.\n",
      " That is dash one.\n",
      " You might prefer this layout.\n",
      " We have another option, dash L, for seeing a long listing.\n",
      " This listing includes more details.\n",
      " So in the first column, we have the permissions of this file or directory.\n",
      " The first time you see this, it might look really scary, but trust me, it's easier than\n",
      " you think.\n",
      " We'll talk about that later in this section.\n",
      " Over here, you can see the user that owns this file or directory.\n",
      " We can see the size.\n",
      " We can see the date and so on.\n",
      " Now to change the current directory, we use the CD command.\n",
      " We have the same command in Windows.\n",
      " Now here we can type a relative or an absolute path.\n",
      " A relative path is relative to where we are.\n",
      " So in this root directory, we have directories like bin, boot and so on.\n",
      " So this is a relative path.\n",
      " Now in contrast, an absolute path always starts from the root directory.\n",
      " So let's go to a directory starting with e.\n",
      " Now we can press tab to get all the completion.\n",
      " Beautiful.\n",
      " Now let's go to a directory starting with a.\n",
      " Now if you press tab, nothing happens because we have multiple directories starting with\n",
      " a.\n",
      " Now we can press tab one more time.\n",
      " Great.\n",
      " So you have three entries, three directories at user.conf, alternatives and app.\n",
      " So let's type the second letter P and then press tab.\n",
      " Beautiful.\n",
      " Now let's see what we have in this directory.\n",
      " So these blue items are directories and sources that list is a file.\n",
      " Now to get out of this directory, we can go one level up by typing two periods.\n",
      " Again, I'm pretty sure you're familiar with this, but I want to cover it to make this\n",
      " section comprehensive.\n",
      " So we can go one level up to get to the Etsy directory or two levels up to get to the\n",
      " root directory.\n",
      " Look, we're currently in the root directory.\n",
      " Now when using LS, we can optionally specify a path.\n",
      " Let's say I'm somewhere in the file system, but I want to look at the content of another\n",
      " directory.\n",
      " I don't want to navigate to that directory.\n",
      " So I'm currently in the root directory.\n",
      " I want to know what files and directories we have inside the bean directory.\n",
      " So once again, we can type a relative path or an absolute path starting from the root\n",
      " directory.\n",
      " So here are the binaries in this directory.\n",
      " Look at PWD.\n",
      " That's the command that we just execute.\n",
      " So PWD is a program in this directory.\n",
      " Here's another example.\n",
      " Look at Echo.\n",
      " So most of the commands we have been exploring so far are programs or binaries in the bin\n",
      " directory.\n",
      " Okay?\n",
      " Now let me show you a shortcut.\n",
      " Earlier I told you that here we have this home directory where each user has a home directory.\n",
      " But the root user has a special home directory called root.\n",
      " Now to get here, there are two options.\n",
      " We can type an absolute or relative path and go to root, but there is a shortcut.\n",
      " So let me get out of this directory.\n",
      " So I'm currently in the root directory.\n",
      " To get to my home directory, I can type a tilde and this applies to all users, not just\n",
      " the root user.\n",
      " Whenever we type CD, tilde, we go to our home directory.\n",
      " Now, right now there is nothing here, but in the next lesson I will show you how to create\n",
      " some files in this directory.\n",
      " So before moving on to the next lesson, I want you to spend a couple of minutes and play\n",
      " with the commands we explored in this lesson.\n",
      " And having it the file system, get adventurous, see what you can discover.\n",
      " I'll see you in the next lesson.\n",
      " Let's see how we can manipulate files and directories.\n",
      " So I'm currently in the root directory and I want to go to my home directory.\n",
      " How can I do that?\n",
      " Do you remember?\n",
      " We type CD, tilde, right?\n",
      " Now in this directory, I want to create a directory called test.\n",
      " So we type MKDurr, test.\n",
      " Let's verify.\n",
      " It's right here.\n",
      " As I told you before, blue represents a directory.\n",
      " Now, let's say we want to rename this directory.\n",
      " How do we do that?\n",
      " We use the move command.\n",
      " With this we can rename files and folders or move them somewhere else.\n",
      " So we can move or rename test to Docker.\n",
      " All right, beautiful.\n",
      " Now let's go in this directory.\n",
      " Not to create a new file, we use the touch command.\n",
      " So we can create hello.txt.\n",
      " Look, we have this new file here.\n",
      " This is a new M to file.\n",
      " In the next lesson, I will show you how to edit files.\n",
      " So for now, don't worry about it.\n",
      " Also, using the touch command, we can create multiple files in one go.\n",
      " So we can create file 1, file 2, and file 3.\n",
      " Now take a look, beautiful.\n",
      " Now I've got a question for you.\n",
      " How do we list those files with a single file per line?\n",
      " Do you remember?\n",
      " We type ls-1.\n",
      " Now let's say we want to rename hello.txt to something else.\n",
      " Once again, we can use the move command.\n",
      " So we type h, press tab to get auto completion.\n",
      " We can rename this to hello-darker.txt.\n",
      " Or we can move it to a different directory.\n",
      " For example, we can move it to the Etsy directory.\n",
      " And here I'm using an absolute path.\n",
      " Because my path has started from the root directory.\n",
      " Now in this lesson, I don't want to move this anywhere.\n",
      " So I just want to rename this to hello-darker.txt.\n",
      " And if you're wondering how I remove this entire word in one go,\n",
      " I press control and w.\n",
      " So let's bring it back.\n",
      " Hello-darker.txt.\n",
      " Take a look.\n",
      " Good.\n",
      " Now let's see how we can remove one or more files.\n",
      " To do that, use the RM command.\n",
      " Like here, we can type one or more files.\n",
      " So we can say file 1.txt, file 2.txt, or we can use a pattern.\n",
      " For example, I can say I want to remove all files that start with file.\n",
      " Let's verify it.\n",
      " Beautiful.\n",
      " We only have hello-darker.\n",
      " Now let's get out of this directory and remove the directory itself.\n",
      " So we type RM, Docker.\n",
      " Now we get an error saying Docker is a directory.\n",
      " So to remove directories, we have to use the R option, which is short for recursive.\n",
      " So we want to remove this directory and all is content recursively.\n",
      " Now we press D, tab, beautiful.\n",
      " So let's verify there is nothing here.\n",
      " So let's quickly recap.\n",
      " We use MKDAR to create a new directory.\n",
      " We use touch to create a new file.\n",
      " We use move to move or rename files or directories.\n",
      " And we use RM to remove files and directories.\n",
      " Now as an exercise, go to your home directory, create a bunch of files and directories,\n",
      " rename them, and then remove them.\n",
      " In the next lesson, I'm going to show you how to view and edit files.\n",
      " Alright, let's see how we can edit and view files.\n",
      " So earlier, we briefly talked about nano.\n",
      " Nano is a basic text editor for Linux.\n",
      " Now on this image that we are running, we don't have nano, so we have to install it.\n",
      " Do you remember the command for installing nano?\n",
      " That is apt install nano.\n",
      " Alright, now we have nano.\n",
      " So we can launch it and optionally supply a file name.\n",
      " Let's say file one, the TXT.\n",
      " So here we have a basic text editor.\n",
      " We can type whatever we want.\n",
      " And when we are done, look down below.\n",
      " The shortcut for exiting is control and x.\n",
      " So I'm going to press that.\n",
      " Now it's asking if you want to save the changes.\n",
      " So we press yes.\n",
      " And here we confirm the file name.\n",
      " We can keep the same file or change the file name.\n",
      " Let's go ahead.\n",
      " So down in this directory, we have file one.txt.\n",
      " Beautiful.\n",
      " Now to see the content of this file, we have a few different commands.\n",
      " The simplest one is cat.\n",
      " And this is nothing to do with cats.\n",
      " It's short for concatenate.\n",
      " So later I will show you how we can use this command to concatenate or combine multiple\n",
      " files.\n",
      " But with cat, we can also see the content of a file.\n",
      " So if you say cat file one.txt, we can see the content of this file.\n",
      " Now cat is useful if our file is short and fits on one page.\n",
      " But if you're dealing with a long file, it's better to use the more command.\n",
      " Let me give you an example.\n",
      " So I'm going to use cat to show the content of this file.\n",
      " Slash Etsy slash adduser.conf.\n",
      " This is a really long file.\n",
      " So if I scroll up, look, we have a lot of text.\n",
      " Now sometimes you don't want to see all the content in one go.\n",
      " You want to scroll down.\n",
      " You want to go page by page.\n",
      " This is where we use the more command.\n",
      " So more slash Etsy slash adduser.conf.\n",
      " Now down below, look, you can see more 15%.\n",
      " So we're seeing 15% of this file.\n",
      " Now if you press space, we can go to the next page.\n",
      " So now we're at the position 33%.\n",
      " Alternatively, we can press enter to go one line at a time.\n",
      " Now the problem with more is that we can only scroll down.\n",
      " We cannot scroll up.\n",
      " So to do that, we have to use a different command called less.\n",
      " So to exit here, we press Q.\n",
      " Good.\n",
      " Now in this image, we don't have less.\n",
      " So once again, we have to manually install it.\n",
      " So apt install less.\n",
      " So less is a newer command that is supposed to replace more.\n",
      " Let's go ahead.\n",
      " Great.\n",
      " So let's look at the same file using the less command.\n",
      " Slash Etsy slash adduser.conf.\n",
      " So now using the up and down arrows,\n",
      " we can scroll down or up.\n",
      " So just by pressing up and down arrows, we also have space.\n",
      " We can go to the next page and enter just like the more command.\n",
      " And when we are done, we can press Q.\n",
      " Now we have a couple more commands for viewing the content of a file.\n",
      " We have head, which we can use to display the first few lines.\n",
      " So here we can supply an option and say the number of lines we want to see is five.\n",
      " Let's look at the same file.\n",
      " So this shows the first five lines of this file.\n",
      " Similarly, we have tail.\n",
      " We chose the last few lines.\n",
      " So we supply an option and say we want to look at the last five files.\n",
      " That's it.\n",
      " So to recap, we can use nano to read something to a file.\n",
      " We can use cat to view the content of small files.\n",
      " Less to view the content of long files in an interactive way.\n",
      " And head and tail to view the first view or the last few lines of a file.\n",
      " One of the important concepts in Linux is the concept of standard input and output.\n",
      " So standard input represents the keyboard and standard output represents the screen.\n",
      " But we can always change the source of the input or the output.\n",
      " This is called redirection.\n",
      " Let me show you using a few examples.\n",
      " So we talked about the cat command to see the content of a file.\n",
      " Let's say file one to TXT.\n",
      " When we execute this command, this command or this program reads data from this file\n",
      " and prints it on the standard output, which is the screen.\n",
      " That is why we see the content here.\n",
      " But using the redirection operator, which is the greater than sign,\n",
      " we can redirect the output from the screen to, let's say, a different file.\n",
      " So now cat will read the content from this file and write it to this file.\n",
      " Take a look.\n",
      " So we have file to the TXT.\n",
      " If we view it, we see the exact same content as file one.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now what is the point of this?\n",
      " Well, earlier, I told you that we can use the cat command to concatenate or combine multiple files.\n",
      " So here we can say cat file one to TXT and file to the TXT.\n",
      " If we present her, cat is going to read the data from both these files and printed on the terminal,\n",
      " which is the standard output.\n",
      " But once again, using the redirection operator, we can write the result to a different file.\n",
      " Combined the TXT.\n",
      " So this is how we can use this command to combine multiple files.\n",
      " Now, the redirection operator is not limited to the cat command.\n",
      " We can use it pretty much anywhere.\n",
      " For example, earlier we talked about the echo command.\n",
      " If we say echo, hello,\n",
      " we see the result on the terminal.\n",
      " But if we say echo, hello, to hello.txt.\n",
      " Now we have a new file here, hello.txt, which contains hello.\n",
      " So if you want to write a single line to a file, we don't have to use nano.\n",
      " We can use the echo command.\n",
      " So echo whatever to whatever file the TXT.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now here's a little exercise for you.\n",
      " I want you to get a long listing of the files in the Etsy directory\n",
      " and write the output to a file.\n",
      " So pause the video and work on this for a few seconds.\n",
      " So here's the solution.\n",
      " To get a long listing, we type ls-l,\n",
      " then we specify the path, the Etsy directory.\n",
      " Now, instead of printing the result on the terminal,\n",
      " we're going to write it to a file called files.txt.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Now let's view this file.\n",
      " Perfect.\n",
      " Now one more thing before we finish this lesson.\n",
      " Using the greater an unsigned, we can redirect the standard output,\n",
      " but we also have the less than sign to redirect the standard input.\n",
      " I personally haven't found many use cases for this,\n",
      " so I didn't cover it in this lesson.\n",
      " All right, that's all about redirection.\n",
      " Next, we're going to talk about searching for text and files.\n",
      " Hey guys, Moch here.\n",
      " If you're serious about learning Docker,\n",
      " I actually have a complete Docker course\n",
